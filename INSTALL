If you have not read file "README", you should.


Installation:

To build this project you need to make sure cmake is installed. After cmake
is available you can use the following command to configure the project:

    cmake .

or when you want to manually specify where to install vrb, use:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr .

Once it builds the various Makefiles, then you can do:

    make clean
    make install

You can also do just "make" to see it compile without installing.

Installation includes the library, version symlinks for the library, header
files, and demo programs.  There are also test programs but those are not
installed.  The demo programs differ from the test programs in that the
demo programs have some potential uses.

You will need to update your system library cache.  Read your system man
page for "ldconfig" for particulars.

Man pages are also included, but they are NOT installed automatically.
They will need to be copied manually to install them.


Warning:

This is an BETA release.  API's are NOT finalized and may change without
specific mention of the changes being made.  While I encourage others to
use the library, at present I do not encourage distribution of programs
that use the library until a final release.
