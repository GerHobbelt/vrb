Vitrual Ring Buffer library for Debian
--------------------------------------

The -fgnu-linker and -fmove-all-movables compiler options are removed
from configure in order to compile with recent gcc versions (such as
the ones used in Debian) (subject to upstream fix).

The -nostartfiles and -nostdlib compiler options were also removed
from configure so shlibs dependencies can be determined by debhelper.
