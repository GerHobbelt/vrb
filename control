Description: Virtual Ring Buffer library
 The Virtual Ring Buffer (VRB) is an implementation of a character
 FIFO ring buffer. A ring buffer is a special memory area, because
 writing beyond the end of it actually results in a write at the
 beginning. Such a construct comes very handy in applications where
 one end of a communications channel is required to produce or consume
 data at a constant rate, but the other end cannot gurantee this. This
 is a common situation in multimedia applications or Voice-over-IP
 solutions, for example.
 .
 VRB provides direct access to the buffer so the calling program can
 construct output data in place, or parse input data in place, without
 the extra step of copying data to or from a calling program provided
 buffer area, thus provides a highly efficient ring buffer
 implementation.

 This package contains the program vbuf, which implements nothing but
 a simple ring buffer, so it can be used directly from the shell.
